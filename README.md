<h2>About 📖</h2>

Chat App with Flutter 💙 and Firebase 💛.

With this application you can chat with people, acessing it via your Google Account, sending and receiving messages and photos, and entering different accounts with each message you send.

As a backend, I used Firebase, noSQL and in real time, which gives you flexibility, easy development, manipulation and structuring, you can see more on the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase Website</a>.

## Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯

This application was very challenging for me, but it was very good for my learning about backend, and I loved this experience of developing one on Firebase, which I had heard about, but never created anything, and I was so impressed functionality!

All these moments of problems only increased my interest in this incredible world of programming, which I hope to secceed and stay focused on, I am loving it! Is sensational!

Another challenge I faced was updating the project. Because it had been coded 3 years ago, and the update was not that simple. It was a cool experience and one that brought me good learnings.
